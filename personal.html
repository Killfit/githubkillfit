                                <p class="aboutText">Am Brian Killian Ngala<br>
                                    I'm a Fitness Enthusiast and a fitness freak based in Nairobi Kenya. <br>
                                     My passion for fitness began with my own life experience back in 2010 as i completed highschool.
    Like many young people, I thought I could eat anything I wanted and not be affected until my bad habit of consuming a lot of  foods caught up with me as my clothes began to fit more snug than I was comfortable with. Besides having an expanding waistline, I was frequently tired and maintained a low energy level and required the assistance of 5 Hour Energy drinks to give me the boost I needed to make it through the day.  Up until this point, healthy eating and physical activity never crossed my mind, and I had no clue (because I was uneducated) that my body was behaving in the manner that it was because I was not caring for it appropriately.  A pair of pants ripping while bending over to put on my shoes  marked the beginning of my fitness journey toward a new me.  Because I desired to look and feel better, I was compelled to find the answers about how to do just that.
    But finding the right answers usually start with asking the right questions.  In the beginning, I wanted to know how I could lose weight fast, so the only answers I cared to receive were of the quick results variety.  I tried several of the popular weight loss fads that included juicing, colon cleanses, and various diets.  I never asked if these methods were safe, effective long-term, or appropriate for my goals.  I also did not ask if it was ok for me to continue eating foods that put the pounds on in the first place.  You see, I wanted to experience  a change without changing.  I wanted these weight loss gimmicks to shed pounds off me without the need for me to give up the sweets I enjoyed or requiring that I engage in any physical activity.  In other words, I wanted to remain complacent and stuck in who I was  and take short-cuts and cheat the process.  This was just the beginning of my journey and though I had a desire for change in my life, that desire was not yet strong enough because I continued to do the things that jeopardized any hope I had for weight loss.
    The quick results tactics were not the answer and proved ineffective.<br>

  i specialize in the Body Composition<br>	 
There are many ways to measure body composition - the approximation of the percentage of fat versus lean muscle mass, bone, blood, etc. We use a circumference based method.
Measurements: Measure the circumference at your waist, neck, and hips (for women) or at the level of the navel (for men). Use the same measurement units that you used for your height.
