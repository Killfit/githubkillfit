        <h2>BEST WORKOUT ROUTINES</h2>

        <p> My favorite workout is riding my bike. It's summer here in Kenya now, so I can finally ride in Central Park. And, I love to get out there and do a couple loops. <br>  My favorite workout routine is running and some weight training. It's so easy, I travel so much for work, all I need is my sneakers and a good sports bra, and I can run anytime, and it's the most incredible way of getting to know the place that you're visiting. Cuz when you're running early in the morning, it's just you and the place, so that's my favorite routine.   My favorite workout is always body workouts. I've, you know, been a runner for a long time. I also really like spin classes, especially a lot of these spin classes that incorporate upper body moves and, you know, a lot of dance music. And also yoga. I'm not like a hardcore yogi, I'm more of like, a relaxed yoga person. <br>  My favorite workout right now is hiking, actually. I live in the country. I'm obsessed with hiking Mount Longonot<br>It's so hard for me but it's beautiful. When you get to the top, you feel really rewarded. You get to see the whole city. So, it's my favorite thing. It's fun, but it's a great workout.   </p>
