  <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
  <a href="#demo" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse">INFO</a>
  <div id="demo" class="collapse">
     My passion for fitness began with my own life experience back in 2010 as i completed highschool.
    Like many young people, I thought I could eat anything I wanted and not be affected until my bad habit of consuming a lot of  foods caught up with me as my clothes began to fit more snug than I was comfortable with. Besides having an expanding waistline, I was frequently tired and maintained a low energy level and required the assistance of 5 Hour Energy drinks to give me the boost I needed to make it through the day.  Up until this point, healthy eating and physical activity never crossed my mind, and I had no clue (because I was uneducated) that my body was behaving in the manner that it was because I was not caring for it appropriately.  A pair of pants ripping while bending over to put on my shoes  marked the beginning of my fitness journey toward a new me.  Because I desired to look and feel better, I was compelled to find the answers about how to do just that.
    But finding the right answers usually start with asking the right questions.  In the beginning, I wanted to know how I could lose weight fast, so the only answers I cared to receive were of the quick results variety.  I tried several of the popular weight loss fads that included juicing, colon cleanses, and various diets.  I never asked if these methods were safe, effective long-term, or appropriate for my goals.  I also did not ask if it was ok for me to continue eating foods that put the pounds on in the first place.  You see, I wanted to experience  a change without changing.  I wanted these weight loss gimmicks to shed pounds off me without the need for me to give up the sweets I enjoyed or requiring that I engage in any physical activity.  In other words, I wanted to remain complacent and stuck in who I was  and take short-cuts and cheat the process.  This was just the beginning of my journey and though I had a desire for change in my life, that desire was not yet strong enough because I continued to do the things that jeopardized any hope I had for weight loss.
    The quick results tactics were not the answer and proved ineffective.
